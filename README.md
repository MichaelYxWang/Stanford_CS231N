# Stanford_CS231N
The goal of setting up this repo is to make full use of Stanford CS 231N course.

This repo mainly provides the following features:
1. For review purpose : A more convenient visualization of jupyter notebooks without setting up notebook server locally.
2. The references of papers which appear in the 5 courses as well as some notes about the papers
3. Nicely commented code from helper functions to project architecture as well as a guideline of how to go through them
4. Extend the project to end to end system: from data labeling to research diary
